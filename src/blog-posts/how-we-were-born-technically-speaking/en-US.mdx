## How We Were Born (Technically Speaking)

Building Migos wasn't just about creating a platform for Secret Santa; it was about crafting an experience that feels effortless, reliable, and modern. From the start, we wanted Migos to stand out, not only in design but in the technology driving it. Here's a look at how we brought Migos to life, technically speaking.

## The Core Tech Stack

We chose tools and frameworks that prioritize performance, scalability, and developer experience:

- <AnimatedLink href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js 15</AnimatedLink> for the front end, with its cutting-edge features like Turbopack, Server Actions, and React Server Components (RSC) for seamless performance.
- <AnimatedLink href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS</AnimatedLink> for responsive and clean styling, allowing us to iterate on the design quickly.
- <AnimatedLink href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</AnimatedLink> for type safety and reducing runtime errors.
- <AnimatedLink href="https://fastify.io">Fastify</AnimatedLink> for a lightweight, high-performance back end.
- <AnimatedLink href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</AnimatedLink> as our reliable and robust database.
- <AnimatedLink href="https://orm.drizzle.team">Drizzle ORM</AnimatedLink> for type-safe, efficient database interactions.
- <AnimatedLink href="https://casl.js.org">CASL</AnimatedLink> for fine-grained permissions management in group settings.
- <AnimatedLink href="https://resend.com">Resend</AnimatedLink> for fast and secure email notifications to keep users updated.

## Why We Chose This Stack

- Next.js 15: Performance and Flexibility

The latest version of Next.js offered powerful features like:
  - Edge Rendering: Delivering low-latency responses globally.
  - Server Actions: Simplifying server-side logic like our secure Secret Santa draw process.

- Tailwind CSS: Speed and Consistency

With Tailwind, we could maintain a visually cohesive design system while moving quickly. Its utility-first approach allowed us to balance functionality and aesthetics without sacrificing either.

- TypeScript: Reliability at Scale

Type safety meant fewer bugs, easier refactoring, and a smoother development process, especially as our codebase grew.

- Fastify + PostgreSQL: Power and Scalability

Fastify ensured fast routing and lightweight performance, while PostgreSQL provided a solid foundation for managing data. Together, they created a back end capable of scaling with our users.

- Drizzle ORM: Clean Database Access

With a modern, type-safe API, Drizzle ORM enabled us to write efficient database queries while maintaining full type safety with TypeScript.

- CASL: Permissions Made Easy

Using CASL, we created a secure and flexible permissions system, ensuring that only group organizers could modify settings, while participants only accessed relevant information.

- Resend: Seamless Email Integration

Resend allowed us to notify users effortlessly, whether it was sending group invites or Secret Santa pairings. Its API-first approach aligned perfectly with our stack.

## How It All Comes Together

Every decision in our tech stack was made to support the ultimate goal: a user experience that feels intuitive and effortless. From responsive interfaces to secure, server-side processing of sensitive data, Migos was designed to be both robust and user-friendly.

This tech foundation has not only allowed us to launch successfully but also to plan confidently for the future. With features like a mobile app and expanded group activities on the horizon, we're excited to continue evolving Migos while staying true to the principles that brought it to life.

What began as a simple idea among friends has grown into something much biggerâ€”thanks to the power of modern technology.
